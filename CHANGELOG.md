# Changelog

## 1.4.1

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed "Reset to Defaults" blanking all settings instead of restoring them** (Issue #149a, branch `bugfix/issue-149a`): "Reset to Defaults" was clearing all fields to empty/false instead of populating them with their actual default values
  - `resetToDefaults()` now reads from `window.DEFAULT_CONFIG` and restores each field to its proper default, matching the same logic used on initial page load
- **Fixed `BK_INSTRUCTIONS_ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS` being treated as a string instead of a list** (Issue #149b, branch `bugfix/issue-149b`): When this setting was saved via the admin panel, it was stored and cast as a plain string rather than a list, causing it to be iterated character by character (e.g. `['.', 'p', 'd', 'f']` instead of `['.pdf']`)
  - Added `allowed_extensions` to the list-type keyword detection in `_cast_value()`, matching the existing pattern used for `badge_order` settings
- **Fixed crash when importing sets containing minifigures or parts with no image on Rebrickable** (Issue #149c, branch `bugfix/issue-149c`): Adding or refreshing a set would fail entirely if any minifigure or part had no image URL, with error `Invalid URL '': No scheme supplied`
  - Rebrickable returns an empty string (not `None`) for missing images; normalize empty strings to `None` at the point of ingestion in `rebrickable_minifigure.py` and `individual_minifigure.py`, matching the existing pattern in `rebrickable_set.py`
  - Updated `rebrickable_image.py` to treat empty strings the same as `None` throughout, falling back to the configured nil placeholder image
  - Note: the originally reported sets could no longer reproduce the crash (images may have since been added on Rebrickable), so this fix is based on asumptions only
- **Fixed deleting a wish with an owner assigned** (Issue #152, branch `bugfix/issue-152`): Resolved foreign key constraint error when removing a set from the wishlist that had an owner assigned
  - Wish owners are now deleted before the wish itself, respecting the FK constraint

## 1.4

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed client-side table sorting corruption** (Issue #136): Resolved data corruption when using sort buttons with DataTables header sorting in client-side pagination mode
  - Sort buttons now trigger actual table header clicks instead of using separate `columns.sort()`
  - Header clicks sync button states to match current sort
  - Prevents misaligned images, colors, and links when mixing sorting methods
- **Fixed storage deletion error handling**: Added proper validation and user-friendly error messages when attempting to delete storage locations that are still in use
  - Shows detailed count of items using the storage (sets, individual minifigures, individual parts, part lots)
  - Provides clickable link to storage details page for easy navigation
  - Prevents accidental deletion of storage locations with referenced items
- **Fixed bulk parts redirect**: Corrected endpoint reference from `individual_part.list_all` to `individual_part.list` after route function rename
- **Fixed purchase location templates**: Created missing template files for purchase location pages
- **Fixed set refresh functionality**: Resolved issues with refreshing sets from Rebrickable
  - Fixed foreign key constraint errors during refresh by reusing existing set IDs instead of generating new UUIDs
  - Implemented UPDATE-then-INSERT pattern to properly update existing parts while preserving user tracking data
  - Part quantities now correctly sync with Rebrickable during refresh
  - User tracking data (`checked`, `missing`, `damaged`) is preserved across refreshes
  - New parts from Rebrickable are added to local inventory during refresh
  - Orphaned parts (parts no longer in Rebrickable's inventory) are now properly removed during refresh
  - Refresh now works correctly for both set parts and minifigure parts
  - Uses temporary tracking table to identify which parts are still valid before cleanup
- **Fixed Socket.IO connections behind reverse proxies**: Resolved WebSocket disconnection issues when using Traefik, Nginx, or other reverse proxies
  - Root cause: Setting `BK_DOMAIN_NAME` enables strict CORS checking that fails with reverse proxies
  - Solution: Leave `BK_DOMAIN_NAME` empty for reverse proxy deployments (allows all origins by default)
  - Added debug logging for Socket.IO connections to help troubleshoot proxy issues
- **Fixed bulk import hanging on empty set numbers**: Resolved issue where trailing commas in bulk import input would cause infinite loops
  - Empty strings from trailing commas (e.g., `"10312, 21348, "`) are now filtered out before processing
  - Prevents "Set number cannot be empty" errors from blocking the bulk import queue
- **Added notes display toggles**: Added configuration options to show/hide notes on grid and detail views
  - New `BK_SHOW_NOTES_GRID` setting (default: `false`) - controls whether notes appear on grid view cards
  - New `BK_SHOW_NOTES_DETAIL` setting (default: `true`) - controls whether notes appear on set detail pages
  - Notes display as an info alert box below badges when enabled
  - Both settings can be toggled in Admin -> Live Settings panel without container restart
  - Fixed consolidated SQL query to include description field for proper notes display in server-side pagination
- **Fixed permission denied when running as non-root user** (Issue #138): Resolved container startup failure when using `user:` directive in docker-compose
  - Added `chmod -R a+rX /app` to Dockerfile to ensure all files are readable regardless of build environment
  - Added commented `user:` example in `compose.yaml` to document non-root support

### Breaking Changes

- **Parts default order column names changed**: The `BK_PARTS_DEFAULT_ORDER` environment variable now uses `"combined"` instead of `"bricktracker_parts"` for column references
  - If you have a custom `BK_PARTS_DEFAULT_ORDER` setting, update column references:
    - `"bricktracker_parts"."spare"` → `"combined"."spare"`
    - `"bricktracker_parts"."part"` → `"combined"."part"`
    - `"bricktracker_parts"."quantity"` → `"combined"."quantity"`
  - Or remove the custom setting to use the new defaults
  - See `.env.sample` for the full list of available column names

## 1.3

### Breaking Changes 

#### Data Folder Consolidation

> **Warning** 
> **BREAKING CHANGE**: Version 1.3 consolidates all user data into a single `data/` folder for easier backup and volume mapping.

- **Path handling**: All relative paths are now resolved relative to the application root (`/app` in Docker)
  - Example: `data/app.db` → `/app/data/app.db`

- **New default paths** (automatically used for new installations):
  - Database: `data/app.db` (was: `app.db` in root)
  - Configuration: `data/.env` (was: `.env` in root) - *optional, backward compatible*
  - CSV files: `data/*.csv` (was: `*.csv` in root)
  - Images/PDFs: `data/{sets,parts,minifigures,instructions}/` (was: `static/*`)

- **Configuration file (.env) location**:
  - New recommended location: `data/.env` (included in data volume, settings persist)
  - Backward compatible: `.env` in root still works (requires volume mount for admin panel persistence)
  - Priority: `data/.env` > `.env` (automatic detection, no migration required)

- **Migration options**:
  1. **Migrate to new structure** (recommended - single volume for all data including .env)
  2. **Keep current setup** (backward compatible - old paths continue to work)

See [Migration Guide](docs/migration_guide.md) for detailed instructions

#### Default Minifigures Folder Change

> **Warning**
> **BREAKING CHANGE**: Default minifigures folder path changed from `minifigs` to `minifigures`

- **Impact**: Users who relied on the default `BK_MINIFIGURES_FOLDER` value (without explicitly setting it) will need to either:
  1. Set `BK_MINIFIGURES_FOLDER=minifigs` in their environment to maintain existing behavior, or
  2. Rename their existing `minifigs` folder to `minifigures`
- **No impact**: Users who already have `BK_MINIFIGURES_FOLDER` explicitly configured
- Improved consistency across documentation and Docker configurations

### New Features
